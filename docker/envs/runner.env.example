# Copy this file to docker/envs/<name>.env and fill in the values before starting the runner
# Example: cp docker/envs/runner.env.example docker/envs/clocktopus.env

# Required: scope (repo) and repository URL the runner should register against
RUNNER_URL=https://github.com/artificialcrafts/clocktopus
# Optional: override scope detection (repo|org). Default is derived from RUNNER_URL
# RUNNER_SCOPE=repo

# Runner identity and labels
RUNNER_NAME=clocktopus-runner
RUNNER_LABELS=self-hosted,linux,deploy
RUNNER_GROUP=Default

# Host path that contains the deployment targets (mounted to /apps inside the container)
HOST_APPS_PATH=/home/artificialcrafts/apps
# Host SSH directory to mount read-only into the runner (for git over SSH)
HOST_SSH_PATH=/home/artificialcrafts/.ssh
# Optional: override UID/GID used to run the runner container (needed if docker.sock is restricted)
# RUNNER_UID=1000
# RUNNER_GID=1000

# Authentication: provide either a short-lived RUNNER_TOKEN or a long-lived GITHUB_PAT
# If GITHUB_PAT is set, RUNNER_TOKEN can stay empty and the runner will request tokens on startup
